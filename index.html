Meera wakes up after a terrible accident with no memory to herself. She sees a stranger in the mirror and seems to be living with another stranger, Ashruth.
Before she gets used to responding when she is addressed ‘Meera’, Ashruth dumps her with a story that he says is her past. He claims that they were so much in love with each other and that they were engaged.
Armed with what seems to be her personal diary, Meera tries to grasp her identity and her reality. But no matter how hard she tries, she just seems to be unable to connect.
Will Meera ever regain her memory?
Will she fall in love with him the same way?
Or, wait, is he lying to her?
What makes her fall in love with Santhosh, her cousin?
Will she choose to stay and battle this through or will she run away to start a life afresh?</p>

                          <p>   How many years did you have to wait to find true love? Avanthika didn’t have to wait too long. She met Gautham right at the age of ten and fell in love with him right at the first sight. She had no idea the way this guy was going to change her life.
(Gautham: Come on! Any relationship with a girl be it love or marriage, changes guys’ life not the girls’. Ask any man out there and edit your blurb accordingly.
Author: Relationships change people and when it is love or marriage it brings in a positive change to one’s life. I was trying to hide the quarrels that we had throughout the book from the readers but you did not give me a choice. Now, jump into the book or you will be found and replaced throughout the book by a different guy. )

Avanthika was a love-one-guy-all-through-life kind of girl.  Gautham was love-a-girl-sincerely-then-move-on-to-the-next-and-start-being-sincere-allover-again kind of guy. Though they were poles apart, no one could imagine them without each other. They remained such close friends for years together.  Before she could express her feelings to him at the age of sixteen, he proposes Avanthika’s good looking close friend. And before she could digest this, he breaks up with her and proposes Avanthika. Though he isn’t sure of anything they get into a relationship. Eventually he falls for her.
Will they retain the love till they become adults? Will maturity kill their puppy love? Will they move apart with the tide of time?

A story of how a puppy love transforms into a strong relationship as it collects maturity in its journey with time.  </p>

                            <p>As writers, we all want to tell stories and keep the readers engaged. In this book you will find 60 prompts. This is not like the other prompt books that you find in the market where they just list one liners as a prompt. In this book you will be given prompts or plots and ways to develop them into various genres. These prompts will not just create a spark in you to create your own story but also guide you to twist and turn them into a story you will be comfortable writing.</p>

                            <p>Every story is a collection of words and a hand full of punctuation. But each story is different and it’s the writers’ responsibility to make every story they write unique. In this book, the author has tried his best to make every story different from each other. This book contains 16 stories. </p>
