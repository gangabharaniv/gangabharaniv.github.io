In this book you will be given prompts or plots and ways to develop them into various genres. These prompts will not just create a spark in you to create your own story but also guide you to twist and turn them into a story you will be comfortable writing.</p>

                              Every story is a collection of words put together in the right order with a hand full of punctuations here and there. When it’s a love story there can only be two people falling in love, either happily end the book or make it a tragedy. But then how can each story be different from the other? It’s the characters, setting, plot and the order of happenings that make one story different from the other. That makes every one of you develop a plot into a story that’s entirely different from the other. This book will provide you with a list of creative plots that can be twisted and turned into several stories. This book will serve as a story guide.

                              <p>Amnesiac Meera wants to discover her past. Engaged to Ashruth, who is also her doctor, she is tempted to run away and forge a new life as she wonders how she ever fell in love with him. Starting life afresh, she decides to give him a chance and explore more about her past in the meanwhile. Reading a diary that she had written before the accident, she learns why she fell for Ashruth but her feelings seem to have changed now. She learns that her dad, Prabhu, is a rich business man living happily with her mom, Nadhiya. Most of her diary pages are filled with memories of Santhosh, her cousin. As she reads about Santhosh and his role in her past life, she starts to like him.

    Ashruth decides to leave Meera at her parent’s residence until their wedding, which is a month away. He tells them that she is like a blank paper and anything that affects her will get imprinted in her. Like a book or a movie, if it affects her deeply, it might make her assume it’s her past. Though she is introduced to her mother and father, she finds herself incapable of trusting them.

    Santhosh, her cousin, grew up in her house as he had lost his parents to a car accident at a young age. She understands from her diary that he was her best friend, right from childhood. As she browses the old videos and photos, her admiration and respect for Santhosh are rekindled. She doubts whether she was in love with Santhosh and whether she has carried her love from her past.

    Will she call off her wedding despite knowing the societal consequences? Will she fall for Santhosh? What if she is married to one of the two and gains her memory later? If she was actually in love with Santhosh, why are people hiding it from her?</p>

                              <p>   How many years did you have to wait to find true love? Avanthika didn’t have to wait too long. She met Gautham right at the age of ten and fell in love with him right at the first sight. She had no idea the way this guy was going to change her life.
    (Gautham: Come on! Any relationship with a girl be it love or marriage, changes guys’ life not the girls’. Ask any man out there and edit your blurb accordingly.
    Author: Relationships change people and when it is love or marriage it brings in a positive change to one’s life. I was trying to hide the quarrels that we had throughout the book from the readers but you did not give me a choice. Now, jump into the book or you will be found and replaced throughout the book by a different guy. )

    Avanthika was a love-one-guy-all-through-life kind of girl.  Gautham was love-a-girl-sincerely-then-move-on-to-the-next-and-start-being-sincere-allover-again kind of guy. Though they were poles apart, no one could imagine them without each other. They remained such close friends for years together.  Before she could express her feelings to him at the age of sixteen, he proposes Avanthika’s good looking close friend. And before she could digest this, he breaks up with her and proposes Avanthika. Though he isn’t sure of anything they get into a relationship. Eventually he falls for her.
    Will they retain the love till they become adults? Will maturity kill their puppy love? Will they move apart with the tide of time?

    A story of how a puppy love transforms into a strong relationship as it collects maturity in its journey with time.  </p>
